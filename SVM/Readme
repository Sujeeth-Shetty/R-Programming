Data:
The “juice.csv” data contains purchase information for Citrus Hill or Minute Maid orange juice. A description of the variables follows.
1. Purchase: A factor with levels CH and MM indicating whether the customer purchased Citrus Hill or Minute Maid Orange Juice
2. WeekofPurchase: Week of purchase
3. StoreID: Store ID
4. PriceCH: Price charged for CH
5. PriceMM: Price charged for MM
6. DiscCH: Discount offered for CH
7. DiscMM: Discount offered for MM
8. SpecialCH: Indicator of special on CH
9. SpecialMM: Indicator of special on MM
10. LoyalCH: Customer brand loyalty for CH
11. SalePriceMM: Sale price for MM
12. SalePriceCH: Sale price for CH
13. PriceDiff: Sale price of MM less sale price of CH
14. Store7: A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the sale is at Store 7
15. PctDiscMM: Percentage discount for MM
16. PctDiscCH: Percentage discount for CH
17. ListPriceDiff: List price of MM less list price of CH
18. STORE: Which of 5 possible stores the sale occured at

Problem Statement:
1. Create a training set containing a random sample of 80% of the observations in the “juice.csv” data set using createDataPartition(). Create a test data set containing the remaining observations.
2. Fit an SVM model with a linear kernel to the training data using cost=0.01. Use Purchase as the response and the other variables as predictors in this model. Use the summary() function to produce summary statistics, and describe the results obtained.
3. What are the training and test error rates?
4. Use the tune() function to select an optimal cost. Consider values in the range 0.01 to 10.
5. Compute and report the training and test error rates using this new value for cost.
6. Repeat parts (2.) through (5.) using a support vector machine with a radial kernel. Use the default value for gamma.
7. Repeat parts (2.) through (5.) using a support vector machine with a polynomial kernel. Set degree=2.
8. Overall, which approach seems to give the best results on this data?
