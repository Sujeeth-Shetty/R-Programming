Shiny Assignment 2
Problem Statement:
Use the “ebola_2014_2016.csv” file to create a Shiny app that summarizes
information about the Western African Ebola virus epidemic. Each row in this data
set contains a report from each region or location for each day. Each column
represents the number of cases reported from each country or region
Feel free to present the information in the way you think would be most effective.
One possibility would be to create a dashboard that would include the following
information, among others:
1. The spread of the virus over time
2. The distribution of the virus across countries on a map
3. The fatality and recovery rate of those infected by the virus
For additional ideas on how to present the information check out the current
COVID-19 dashboard available at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.
